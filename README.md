# DashboardApp

This project is a simple starter dashboard built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – entry HTML file mounting the React app on the `#root` element.
- `src/main.tsx` – bootstraps React and renders the `<App />` component.
- `src/App.tsx` – main React component. Start building your interface here.
- `src/index.css` – Tailwind CSS imports.

Vite handles the build and development process, React provides the UI framework, TypeScript adds type safety, and Tailwind offers utility-first styling.
